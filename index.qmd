## About Me

My name is **Jacob Nesslage** and I am a **PhD Candidate** in the **Environmental Systems Graduate Group** at the **University of California, Merced (UC Merced)**.

My background is in **environmental engineering**, **spatial ecology**, and **remote sensing**.

In my current research, I utilize **remote sensing** data from **satellites**, **drones**, and **aircraft**, as well as in-situ surveys of plants and macroinvertebrates, and collections of **environmental DNA** from soils, sediments, and water to assess, monitor, and model biodiversity.

I am also very interested in how **hydrology** and **geomorphology** converge to shape **biodiversity** and subsequent **ecosystem functions and services** across watersheds. Given the intrinsic link between life and water, much of my research focuses on the unique ecosystems where biodiversity and water converge, such as **floodplains**, **riparian forests**, and **ephemeral wetlands**.

I am an advocate for the use of **open-source geospatial code, tools, and data**. I am most comfortable coding in **R** or **Python**, although I occasionally use **Javascript** and **Bash** for specific geospatial applications.
